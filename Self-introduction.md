Hi everyone!

I am June, came from China and now live in Houston. I graduated from University of Houston as a PHD in EE and then devoted my five years into the oil and gas industry... Somehow I start liking CS... Luckily, in this June (not my name....), I got a chance and was enrolled in Udacity self driving car program. The program is great! I will do all my best! Â Wish me good luck! And looking forwrad to the comments from you, my friends!
